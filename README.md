# BombermanOS

 <img src="gitFiles/BombermanOS_logo.png?raw=true">

BombermanOS is software for cardputerADV, primarily designed for media playback and file display.

Currently, it can play MP3 files, and in the future, I hope to enable playback via Bluetooth.

Soon, features for viewing and editing text, as well as viewing images, are planned.
